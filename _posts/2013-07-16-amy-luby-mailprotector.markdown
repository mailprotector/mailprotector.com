Virtual Connect Technologies, the company behind the Mailprotector® brand of email security, management and hosting tools, announced today the hiring of Amy Luby as the company’s Global Vice President of Sales and Marketing.

A successful entrepreneur and leader in the Global IT Services Channel, Amy Luby joins Virtual Connect Technologies in the newly-created position of Global Vice President of Sales and Marketing.

In her new role, Amy will take over day-to-day management and growth of the company’s sales team, lead the enrichment of the company’s Channel strategy, and help chart expansion into new markets.

In announcing the hire, Virtual Connect President David Setzer said, "Mailprotector is a pioneer in hosted email security and management offerings, and over the past dozen years we’ve become known for the resiliency of our products. We now want to also be known for our solid commitment to our channel partners, which is why we’ve added someone of Amy’s caliber and credentials to our leadership team."

Amy brings to the Mailprotector brand more than 17 years of experience in the IT Services Channel. Most recently, Amy worked at the global IT security giant Trend Micro managing worldwide product/solution marketing. Prior to that, she held senior positions at Bradford Networks and SYNNEX Corporation. In each of these roles, Amy has taken on challenging assignments and brought her creativity, experience and strong networking skills to deliver results.

Amy is also a proven entrepreneur and pioneer in the IT services industry. In 1995 she founded Mobitech as one of the first true Managed Services Providers (MSPs) in the country. She then parlayed that experience in 2007 by creating MSP Services Network (MSPSN), one of the first "Master MSPs" in the channel, providing education, NOC, Help Desk and other hosted fulfillment services to emerging MSPs and VARs transitioning to Managed Services. Amy exited both of these successful start-ups after their respective acquisitions in 2007 and 2010.

Amy’s successes in the Channel have not gone unnoticed. She is the recipient of numerous Channel awards including: CRN Channel Chief, MSP Mentor Top 250 Influencers, MSP Mentor Top 100 Global MSPs, SMB Nation’s SMB 150, and COMPTIA’s Industry Leadership Award.

"In the short time I’ve been with Mailprotector, I’ve been working to establish our new Channel program, enhance our sales team and build the infrastructure and process internally to support rapid growth. We will be launching publically our newest Hosted Exchange offering at ChannelCon this month and I am absolutely excited to be working with a company that has such a great product platform. The philosophy and culture at Mailprotector matches well with my own and the company has a very strong development and support team."
