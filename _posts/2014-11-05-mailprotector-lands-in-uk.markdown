#### Mailprotector appoints EAC and Freelance Computers as part of channel drive

Mailprotector, a cloud-based email security, management and hosting specialist, is launching in the UK and across EMEA.  The company, which offers a range of services, including email filtering, archiving, encryption and hosting, is looking to build an impressive network of 50+ channel partners in the UK by the end of 2015.  Resellers can expect attractive margins with aggregate pricing, and an opportunity to win business in an email market expected to top $12 billion worldwide by the end of this year and double over the next four years*.

Headed by Scott Tyson, Sales Director EMEA, Mailprotector has appointed EAC Network Solutions as one of its new partners in the UK.  EAC will use its expertise in key verticals to help drive Mailprotector's UK expansion and deliver the vendor's cloud-based managed services offerings to the market.  The relationship will also enable EAC to expand into new markets and the SMB sector.  Earlier this year, Mailprotector signed up IT services provider, Freelance Computers, and has also recruited additional resellers in the past month.

David Setzer, CEO and founder of Mailprotector, comments: “We have spent several years successfully building our business in the US, designing a platform and products from the ground up.  There’s a huge opportunity today for cloud-based services, which are transforming the way security is delivered and consumed by organisations.  With our expertise and focus on email security, we want to recruit the very best partners in the UK and across EMEA to help us rapidly grow the business over the next year.”

As Sales Director for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Scott Tyson, who was appointed in March, will drive the company’s aggressive growth plans in EMEA markets and work with the US team to develop and launch Mailprotector’s new Partner Program this year.  

“The growth potential for Mailprotector in the region is incredible and we’re already encouraged by early wins and positive feedback from channel partners who see cloud-based email security as a big sales opportunity.  I’m confident the UK will have a strong impact on the global expansion of the business. The next 18 months will be an exciting time for us and our partners, with ambitious sales targets, margins and growth opportunities.” 

Mike Papworth, Managing Director at EAC Network Solutions, adds: “Mailprotector’s heritage is firmly rooted in designing and delivering superior email products.  Having a managed service solution as part of our portfolio means that we can look to grow our business via new revenue streams and offer our resellers and customers new cloud-based email security offerings.”

Gartner predicts around 10% of overall IT security enterprise product capabilities will be delivered in the cloud, and more than 30% of security controls deployed to small or midsize businesses will be cloud-based by 2015. *Source: <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2828722" target="_blank">www.gartner.com</a>*  &#9688;
