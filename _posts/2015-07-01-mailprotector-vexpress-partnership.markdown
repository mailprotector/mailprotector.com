####To deliver cloud-based email security, management and hosting services

Cloud-based email security, management and hosting specialist, Mailprotector has partnered with distributor, VExpress, to help meet growing demand for cloud-based security solutions in Australia and New Zealand. The distribution deal is expected to bring on board between 20 and 30 new resellers to service Mailprotector's expansion into the region after its launch into the UK market last year.

VExpress will resell Mailprotector's full range of email security products, including CloudFilter for inbound and outbound email filtering, SafeSend for outbound filtering with specific oubound policies, SecureStore for email archiving, XtraMail for email backup, ForcEncrypt for email encryption and CloudMail for robust email hosting.

Tasked with driving the company's ambitious growth worldwide, Scott Tyson, Director of Global Sales, Mailprotector, explains: ''We already have some legacy business in Australia, but this new distribution deal will provide real-time account management, support and 'feet on the ground' to help grow this legacy base and bring on new partners at a faster rate than remote organic growth.

''Australia and New Zealand are a perfect match for our cloud-based solutions due to their geographical location and certainly in Australia's case, it's sheer size.  We're also seeing more voice and data resellers looking to augment their services with cloud solutions, and with the rapid change in the Managed Print Service businesses also offering Managed Services, now is a great time to enhance our Australian and New Zealand presence.‚Äù

Xavier Simon at VExpress, adds: ''With a growing demand from customers for cloud solutions, Mailprotector will be a huge addition to our product portfolio, which includes other cloud-based business offerings like NetConnect and LifeSize. Our resellers will also see the benefit of an incremental monthly recurring revenue by offering end to end email security, management and hosting services.''

The enablement process between Mailprotector and VExpress, including remote and on-site training and education, is already underway.

Mailprotector launched in the UK and EMEA in November 2014, looking to build a network of 50+ partners by the end of 2015. The company also signed a major distribution deal with Zycko in March.
