####Growing demand for email security and compliance capabilities from SMBs

Managed IT services and security provider, [Intelli-NET][intellinet-homepage] of SC (Intelli-NET) has been awarded Elite partner status by [Mailprotector][mp-homepage], the cloud-based email security, management and hosting specialist. Intelli-NET was promoted to the highest level of Mailprotector's Partner Program following a stellar year, recording triple digit growth for sales of its email security solutions.

A long-standing partner of Mailprotector, Intelli-NET delivers IT services, hosting and managed sevices for small and medium size businesses (SMBs) and larger firms, including legal firms and healthcare organisations, in and around South Carolina where Mailprotector has its own headquarters.  

Intelli-NET has seen strong growth in its email security business, especially with the demand for products like Mailprotector Exchange+. Mailprotector has also recently integrated their solution in to Intelli-NET’s PSA platform ConnectWise, achieving peak operational efficiency and profitability.

According to Erik Rhine, Co-owner of Intelli-NET: “We chose Mailprotector to be our preferred vendor for email solutions for several reasons. The premium quality of the email filtering and hosted Exchange server is the main one, but also the ease of use for the customer means there is virtually no training required. Also, response times and knowledge from the technical team is outstanding, and pricing is extremely competitive.”

Derek Davis, Managing Partner of Intelli-NET, adds: “MailProtector is a part of our MSP Service Offering because it gives us proven, reliable and controllable email solutions with best-of-breed email filtering. Dealing with MailProtector is quick and efficient and support is real, live and predictable – try getting that from a ‘big box’ provider!”

Brett Hathaway, VP Partner Success, Mailprotector, adds: “We’re delighted that Intelli-NET has supported the Mailprotector business over the years and vice versa – it’s been a great success story and their progression to the top level of our partner program is credit to them. We’ve had a strong personal working relationship with them, which has seen both companies help customers to grow their own businesses as well.”
