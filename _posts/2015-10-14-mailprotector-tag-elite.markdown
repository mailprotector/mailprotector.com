####Reports of strong growth in cloud-based email products

[Mailprotector][mp-homepage] the cloud-based email security, management, and hosting specialist has fast-tracked partner [TAG Solutions][tag-homepage] to Elite status in its global partner program, following growth of more than 400% this year.

A managed services and network security provider, TAG Solutions has seen huge growth in demand for its managed security services capabilities and an increase in customer movement from on-premises to cloud-based email solutions.

TAG Solutions, which resells the complete portfolio of Mailprotector solutions, including cloud filtering, email backup, business continuity services, and email archiving, has seen strong growth come from Exchange+, which combines layered security and continuity services with Microsoft Exchange. The company also sees huge growth in ForcEncrypt sales, Mailprotector's encryption platform from their security-conscious customers within all regulated vertical markets.

“To see 200% growth is excellent, but to see double that in a matter of months is exceptional for any partner,” according to Scott Tyson, Director of Global Sales, Mailprotector. “TAG Solutions has really set the bar in terms of sales opportunities and growth and it was easy to accelerate them from Certified to Elite status. The team there is proactive, positive, and focused on delivering excellent service and first-class products and solutions – we’re proud to have them on board.”

Jeff Miller, Sales Engineer at TAG Solutions adds: “We’ve experienced our fair share of problems with other vendors in the past, but it’s a pleasure to work with Mailprotector, which delivers outstanding service and a broad portfolio of products, combined with excellent pricing and margins. Customers regularly comment on the ease of product use and uptime – plus they’ve reported a huge reduction in the amount of time it takes to replicate data.”
