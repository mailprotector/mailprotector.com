#### Scott Tyson joins Xerox, Ricoh and Tech Data as member of Executive Council

[Mailprotector][mp-homepage], a cloud-based email security, management and hosting specialist, has announced Scott Tyson's election to the UK Channel Community for [CompTIA][comptia-homepage] – a non-profit trade association advancing the global interests of IT professionals and companies.

Director of Global Sales for Mailprotector, Scott joins the UK Channel Community as an Executive Council Member alongside other senior executives from IT organisations, including Vanti, Xerox, Tech Data, Ricoh, Vibrant Networks and Continuum Managed Services.

CompTIA's UK Channel Community provides a resource and forum for UK-based members, made up of retailers, solution providers, distributors, vendors and channel associates, to discuss common issues in the UK channel and to look for joint solutions to strengthen the industry.

''This is an exciting opportunity – both on a personal level, and also for Mailprotector – to be part of the Executive Council for CompTIA, an organisation we respect and have been closely involved with for a number of years,'' explains Scott Tyson. ''We see the organisation very much as the voice of the IT industry, looking to advance the global interests of IT professionals and IT channel organisations and help them to be more successful. I am looking forward to being part of such a forward-looking and positive group of individuals.''

Estelle Johannes, Director, Member Communities UK at CompTIA, adds: “We’re extremely fortunate to have Scott join us as an Executive Council member. His experience in the channel, both at a UK and global level, combined with his insights and perspectives on channel issues facing our industry will be an important addition to the Council and UK Channel Community as a whole.”

Scott brings more than 15 years of experience in channel sales, moving to Mailprotector in February 2014. Recently promoted to a global role, Scott is responsible for managing sales and partners across several territories, including Europe, the US and Australia. Previous experience includes sales and channel roles at Bradford Networks, AdvaTel and SpectraLink.

### Mailprotector will be attending the annual CompTIA EMEA Member & Partner Conference (19-20 October 2015) at etc.venues, 155 Bishopsgate on stand 30. [https://www.comptia.org/emea/home][comptia-event]
