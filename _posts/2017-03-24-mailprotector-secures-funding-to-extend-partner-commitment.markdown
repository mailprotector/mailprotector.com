Mailprotector, the global cloud-based B2B email security, compliance and encryption company announced completion of a mezzanine debt round with Lighter Capital today. Following another exceptional year of growth, this funding will be used to accelerate and expand Mailprotector’s product development, service and market expansion efforts.

"We are pleased to be partnered with Lighter Capital," says David Setzer, CEO of Mailprotector "The professionalism of their team and their understanding of the SaaS and MRR business model is remarkable." This round of funding will also be used to augment the company’s portfolio of business-critical technologies and increase its engagement opportunities with its managed services partner community. To accomplish this, Mailprotector expects to double employee headcount and expand its involvement in industry education and channel-related events this year.

"We are excited to be engaged with one of the leading innovators in this space," says BJ Lackland, CEO of Lighter Capital. "The email management segment of the IT industry is thriving and we look forward to supporting the Mailprotector team’s strategic vision and growth model."

John Yates and Patrick McKenzie of Morris, Manning & Martin, LLP, an international law firm based in Atlanta, GA assisted Mailprotector in the transaction.
