                <p>Mailprotector's parent company, Virtual Connect Technologies, was founded primarily as a website development company. At that time we had developed a couple of intranet sites whose users were fed up with spam, viruses, and the whole lot of issues that come with an unprotected email system. So we rolled up our sleeves and set ourselves to work, and soon we had engineered a basic email filtering system that worked beautifully for our customers.</p>
                <p>Our system worked so well that we decided that we might be able to share it with others. So we re-tooled our system to work as a managed service, added a ton of new and useful features, called it "Mailprotector" and put up a website for it. Soon people started giving Mailprotector a try, then they raved about it to their friends. Before we knew it we were protecting the email of tens of thousands of users and processing millions of messages each day.</p>
                <p class="last">In the years that have followed, Mailprotector has always grown and improved the quality of our service, and we will continue to learn and adapt to the ever changing climate of email security. We love what we do and are excited to be serving our fantastic customers. Don't get us wrong... we're proud of our roots, but this is way more fun than building websites.</p>
