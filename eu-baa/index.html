              <p>This End User Business Associate Agreement (the "Agreement") is an amendment to the License and Services Agreement ("MSA") between Virtual Connect Technologies, Inc. ("Provider") and you and your company ("End User") (each a "Party" and collectively the "Parties"). This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which Provider makes its Mailprotector Online Information, services and products available on this web site (<a href="{{ site.baseurl}}">mailprotector.com</a>) (the "Website"). For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "End User" means any person or entity using the Website, Products, or Services for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, the posting of information, the viewing, uploading, downloading, printing or re-distribution of any images, data or documents in any manner whatsoever.

End User must fully execute a Business Associate Agreement with a channel partner of Provider who has entered into a current and separate Business Associate Agreement describing the terms and conditions to which Provider agrees. Applicable BAA products are defined in the License and Services Agreement. If End User is a company, acceptance of this Agreement by a person on behalf of such company constitutes acceptance by such company, and such person accepting this Agreement on behalf of such company, and its employees and affiliates, End User hereby acknowledges and agrees that Provider reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of all agreements, the products, services, prices and programs mentioned on the Website at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice. Provider reserves the right to seek all remedies available to it, by law and equity, for any violation of the terms and conditions contained herein. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>

                <li>Covered entity shall notify Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of protected health information that covered entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such restriction may affect Business Associate's use or disclosure of protected health information.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>TERM AND TERMINATION</h4>

              <ol type="a">
                <li><span class="underline">Term</span>. The Term of this Agreement shall be effective as of the date signed by both parties below, and shall terminate upon the termination of the MSA or upon the date Covered Entity terminates for cause as authorized in paragraph (b) of this Section, whichever is sooner.</li>

                <li><span class="underline">Termination for Cause</span>. Business Associate authorizes termination of this Agreement by Covered Entity, if Covered Entity determines Business Associate has violated a material term of the Agreement and Business Associate has not cured the breach or ended the violation within ten (10) business days.</li>

                <li><span class="underline">Effect of Termination</span>. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Business Associate, with respect to protected health information received from covered entity, or created, maintained, or received by Business Associate on behalf of covered entity, shall:

                  <ol>
                    <li>Retain only that protected health information which is necessary for Business Associate to continue its proper management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities;</li>
                    <li>Return to Covered Entity [or, if agreed to by covered entity, destroy] the remaining protected health information that the Business Associate still maintains in any form;</li>
                    <li>Continue to use appropriate safeguards and comply with Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to electronic protected health information to prevent use or disclosure of the protected health information, other than as provided for in this Section, for as long as Business Associate retains the protected health information;</li>
                    <li>Not use or disclose the protected health information retained by Business Associate other than for the purposes for which such protected health information was retained and subject to the same conditions set forth in this Agreement; and</li>
                    <li>Return to Covered Entity [or, if agreed to by Covered Entity, destroy] the protected health information retained by Business Associate when it is no longer needed by Business Associate for its proper management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities.</li>
                  </ol>

                  In addition, Covered Entity's termination of this Agreement for cause constitutes good cause for Covered Entity to terminate any Service Attachments signed under the MSA in connection with which Business Associate received any protected health information from Covered Entity.</li>

                <li><span class="underline">Survival</span>. The obligations of Business Associate under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.</li>
