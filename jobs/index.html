                <p>Mailprotector HQ is located in the prospering downtown micro-metropolis of Greenville, SC. It's called "Green"ville for a reason. Step out the front door and stroll along the lush, tree-lined Main St., and in a few minutes you'll find yourself standing on Liberty Bridge viewing the stunning Falls Park (lunch breaks are pretty great here). The Upstate SC area is vibrant, authentic, and full of variety, and provides the perfect setting to enjoy the optimal work/life balance. Plus we're just a stone's throw from the mountains and the beach. It's an amazing city, and we highly recomment that you pay Greenville a visit even if you have no interest in working here. You'll be happy you did.</p>
