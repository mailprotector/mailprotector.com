              <p>The following Terms of Use outline your obligations when using the mailprotector website.  You can also review our <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, which outlines our obligations and practices towards the handling of information that you may provide to us.</p>
              <p>By accessing this site, provided by Virtual Connect Technologies, Inc. &lsquo;Provider', you acknowledge that you have read and agree to abide by the terms described herein. If you do not agree to such terms, you should immediately exit this site.</p>
              <p>Provider may update these Service Terms from time to time without notice. All such guidelines and policies are incorporated by reference into the Service Terms.</p>


              <h4>1. Services provided</h4>
              <p>Provider agrees to provide electronic messaging and or collaboration services including virus protection services and electronic messaging filtering services and/or Hosted Exchange services (the "Services"). Services may also include communications from Provider, including, but not limited to announcements, administrative messages, newsletter, advertisements and such communications. You may not be able to opt out of receiving these items. Features, services or other items subsequently added to the Services shall be subject to the Service Terms.</p>

              <p>Provider reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Services, or any part thereof, without notice. You agree that Provider shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services.</p>


              <h4>2. Service Fees and Payment Terms</h4>
              <p>In return for the Services, you shall pay us Service Fees identified at Exhibit A. If you select monthly billing, you shall pay the full amount owed per month on or before the tenth day of each month. If you fail to pay all amounts owed to us under this MSA when due, then upon at least ten (10) days prior, written notice, we may terminate this agreement or may suspend Services under this agreement until full payment is made. All charges and fees to be paid under this agreement are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise or services taxes that may be assessed on the provision of the Services. You are responsible for the payment of any and all such taxes.</p>

              <h4>3. Your duties</h4>
              <p>You agree to provide true and complete current registration information about yourself and to update such information so as to keep such information current. Failure to honor this clause may result in the suspension or termination of Services in whole or in part.</p>

              <p>You may receive a password and user ID for use with the Services. Please keep the password and user ID confidential, as you are responsible for all activities that occur using your password or account. In the event that you believe that unauthorized use of your account or password is occurring, you will immediately notify Provider.</p>

              <p>You agree to comply with our general business terms, listed here, and in our online Help Center, and also with our Acceptable Use Policy.</p>


              <h4>4. Privacy policy</h4>
              <p>Registration Information and certain other information about you is subject to our <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>  incorporated by reference and subject to change from time to time in our sole and unfettered discretion. The current Privacy Policy is accessible at the following URL: <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/privacy/">https://mailprotector.com/privacy/</a></p>

              <h4>5.	Hosted Exchange Server Availability</h4>

              <p>Provider will use commercial best efforts to provide its Hosted Exchange Customers with 99.9% Exchange server availability measured on a calendar month basis. To ensure optimal performance of servers, Provider will perform routine maintenance on the servers which may require servers to be periodically removed from service. Provider reserves one hour of server unavailability per month for such maintenance purposes and such unavailability will be excluded from uptime calculations. Whenever possible, maintenance will be performed during off-peak hours and Provider will provide advanced notice.</p>

              <p>Under certain circumstances Provider may need to perform emergency maintenance such as security patch installation or hardware replacement. It is not practical to provide advance notice of such emergency maintenance procedures. Server unavailability stemming from such emergency maintenance will be excluded from uptime calculations.</p>

              <p>Provider cannot guarantee availability under any of the following circumstances:

                <ul>
                  <li>Internet congestion</li>
                  <li>Terrorist Attack</li>
                  <li>Acts of God</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h4>6.Use of Microsoft Outlook速 (or Entourage) service</h4>
              <p>Provider's Hosted Exchange Service (only) includes the licensing for Microsoft Outlook速 or Entourage Software. End-users are allowed to install the software one time and only on one PC for each mailbox they purchase. Each end-user/individual using the Provider's Hosted Exchange service must purchase an individual Subscriber Access License (SAL) - otherwise know as a "mailbox" for this service. Sharing of a single mailbox across multiple users is not allowed unless additional licenses are purchased on a monthly basis for each user. If you cancel your Mailprotector Hosted Exchange account you acknowledge that you are responsible for uninstalling any Microsoft Outlook速 or Entourage client software that is licensed as part of the service.  Only Provider's Hosted Exchange Service includes this license - It is not included with other services offered by Provider.</p>


              <h4>7. Indemnity</h4>
              <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Provider, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, or other partners and employees harmless from any liability or damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of Material you submit, post, transmit or make available through the Services, your use of Services, your connection to the Services, your violation of the this Agreement, or your violation of any rights of another.</p>


              <h4>8. Use &amp; Storage</h4>
              <p>Provider may store electronic messages and other Material for a maximum number of days upon expiration of which they may be deleted. Provider may also designate a maximum disk space per user, which, if exceeded, may result in Materials being deleted or the inability to use the Services. You agree that Provider has no responsibility or liability for deletion of any Materials including messaging or other communications.</p>

              <p>Provider also reserves the right to impose an excess usage surcharge if user's activity drastically exceeds normal standards for user's type or size account. Any surcharge will be clearly communicated before imposition.</p>


              <h4>9. Hosted Exchange Backup &amp; Retention Policy</h4>
              <p>Provider's servers are configured to allow recovery of deleted mailboxes or mailbox items for a period of 30 days. If a user deletes an item from their mailbox the system will let them restore it via Microsoft Outlook速. Deleted Item/Mailbox retention allows clients to recover data after they execute a delete command against an individual mailbox or individual mailbox item.</p>
              <p>Provider uses industry standard daily backups of all system configurations and each mail store to provide disaster recovery for a period of 7 days. These backups are maintained in order to provide quick and accurate recovery if a mail store becomes corrupted or fails for another reason. This protects the customer in the event Provider suffers a system failure or other event that requires the recovery of an entire mail store. Provider will not be responsible for retaining any of your data after account termination. All data is deleted from the servers after the account is terminated and from back-ups during scheduled back-up intervals. Provider will not restore, provide on any storage media or send out any data pertaining to terminated accounts.</p>


              <h4>10. Termination</h4>
              <p>Provider, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account or use of the Services, and remove and discard any Material within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, lack of use, violation of this Agreement, or any guidelines or policies. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under any provision herein may be without notice and agree that Provider may immediately delete your account and all related information and files in your account, and prevent future access to Services.</p>

              <p>We do not require long term contracts, however if you decide to cancel your service, you will be charged for the entire billing period in which you request cancellation. We do not pro-rate charges. All cancellation requests must be received in writing at billing@virtualconnect.net from the Administrative Contact's email address.</p>


              <h4>11. Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property</h4>

              <p>The Services and any software used in connection with the Service, ("Software") contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.
